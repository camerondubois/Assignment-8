5. If you knock out this gene, what is the expected phenotype? 
ALKAL2 is one of the genes in betta fish that contribute to coloration, specifically blue. ALKAL2 alleles are associated with a higher proportion of blue coloration of the body of the fish, as well as a decrease in the proportion of red. Therefore, knocking out this gene would result in a betta fish that has a large proportion of blue coloration.
